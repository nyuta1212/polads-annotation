## Greeting and Purpose

Thank you so much for chooing our HITsï¼Ž

As a part our our research project, we are now trying to build a deep neural network model to identify communication techniques in videos (we chose political ad videos as our target). If successful, our model can automatically find why the video is edited in the way it is, telling people some hints on what the video is trying to communicate. 

Below we provide our list of possible communication techniques in videos and then the instruction on how to use our interface to annotate temporal segments. We appreciate your time to read through this instruction to make wonderful annotations. 

**We may apply some criteria to automatically reject your input. Please try to comply with the instruction.**

### Communication Techniques in Videos

Videos usually have something that they want to convey to their viewers. In order to communicate the ideas well with the viewers, they are edited with some techniques. We identify the following techniques:

- **Repetition**: Showing the same idea repeatedly to make viewers believe it.
- **Mood**: Showing scenes with some colors or modify the dominating colors in the scenes so that the scenes give the impressions/emotions associated with the colors. For example, dark colors may imply negative impressions/nemotions; red may imply anger or heat. 
- **Overwhelm**: Showing many visual elements (e.g., changing scenes rapidly or packing many visual elements like images, subtitles, etc. in a scene), sometimes in a chaotic way, which may prevent the viewer from thinking. 
- **Interview**: Showing interview with some people (typically a single person), talking about some ideas as their own ones thought. By this, the viewer may think that the ideas are accepted by (a certian group of or general) people. 
- **Presentation**: Talking or presenting some ideas to convince the viewer. 
- **Implication of Emotion**: Showing some visual elements that imply certain emotions/impressions so that the topic in (the corresponding part of) the video can be associated with these emotions/impressions. For example, talking about a certain candidate in a policical ad video with showing a person with raising his/her clenched fist may imply confidence.
- **Emotiong Mirroring**: This is similar to Implication fo Emotion, but with showing facial expressions (instead of arbitrary visual elements).
- **Implication of Claim**: Showing some visual elements that support a certain idea in (the corresponding part of) the video. The visual elements are not necessarily associated with the context. For example, showing an image of a candidate together with an image of bills may give an impression that the candidate is mean about money. 
- **Implication of Authority**: Showing some visual elements that imply authority to give impression that the idea is authorized, which may not be necessarily the case.
- **Slogans**: Showing a slogan (as a visual element like a subtitle) to impress it.
