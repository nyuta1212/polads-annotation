## Examples

Annotation IDs (such as "emotion-1") are shown on top of the video frames, where the same 
IDs appear in the chart below and the "Comments on each annotation" section (actual IDs 
when you annotate are random letters, but we changed them here for readability). 

The "Comments on each annotation" section shows the comments that you will provide when 
annotating." 

The "Note" section provides explanation about why this video has these annotations.

#### Comments on each annotation

- **interview-1**: talking about Doug Jones  
- **mirroing-1**: smiling or confidence in the faces


### Note

This video is about a candidate, Doug Jones, introduced by Kamala Harris. The video is edited to be an interview, with the intention to highlight his goodness in a third person's viewpoint. So this video should be annotated as "Interview". 

Within the interview setting, some images are shown that are not very relevant to the content of the interview. This can come from the creator's intention to impress positive emotions. Since the emotions are mainly presented in the faces, we choose "Emotion Mirroring".
