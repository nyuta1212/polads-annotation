## Examples

Annotation IDs (such as "emotion-1") are shown on top of the video frames, where the same 
IDs appear in the chart below and the "Comments on each annotation" section (actual IDs 
when you annotate are random letters, but we changed them here for readability). 

The "Comments on each annotation" section shows the comments that you will provide when 
annotating." 

The "Note" section provides explanation about why this video has these annotations.

- **emotion-2**: confident and looking straight


### Note

This video is edited to be an interview to highlight what the candidate did for her, which is intended to show the candidate's positive aspects. Within the interview setting, some scenes are inserted to the videos, and one around 60 second looks especially to give sympathy with the family's situation.
