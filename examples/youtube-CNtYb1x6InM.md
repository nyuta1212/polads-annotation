## Examples

Annotation IDs (such as "emotion-1") are shown on top of the video frames, where the same 
IDs appear in the chart below and the "Comments on each annotation" section (actual IDs 
when you annotate are random letters, but we changed them here for readability). 

The "Comments on each annotation" section shows the comments that you will provide when 
annotating." 

The "Note" section provides explanation about why this video has these annotations.

#### Comments on each annotation

- **claim-1**: claims that Trump is happy with dictators 
- **interview-1**: talking about the brutality
- **authority-1**: perhaps, he is some type of authority
- **claim-2**: claim Trump go along with dictators
- **slogan-1**: end the nightmare
- **overwhelm-1**: shows (perhaps) irrelevant and negative cuts 


### Note

This video is for negative campaigning for Trump. The first part is edited by compiling scenes where Trump praises other countries' leaders, which can be seen as "Implication of Claim". 

In the second part with interview-1 and authority-1 labels, an interview setting is employed, where a person talks about the problem of a certain leader. Perhaps, this person is an authority in some related fields, so "Implication of Authority" is assigned. 

The third part is similar to the first part (claim-2). At the end of this part, there are a flood of perhaps, irrelevant scenes that invokes negative impressions, which is associated with "Overwhelm". 

The video ends with a slogan "END THE NIGHTMARE".
