## Examples

Annotation IDs (such as "emotion-1") are shown on top of the video frames, where the same 
IDs appear in the chart below and the "Comments on each annotation" section (actual IDs 
when you annotate are random letters, but we changed them here for readability). 

The "Comments on each annotation" section shows the comments that you will provide when 
annotating." 

The "Note" section provides explanation about why this video has these annotations.

- **slogan-1**: wrong for Iowa


### Note

This video is for negative campaigning a candidate. After a few second, it starts to talk about the candidate who, perhaps, cannot make a decision on or is unfamiliar with some immigration problems. Either this is truth or not, the intention of the video creator is to highlight her failure. So the video should be annotated with "Implication of Claim". 

This is also presented by her confused facial expression at around 10 second. This can be thought as a part of "Implication of Claim", but the annotator thought that this facial expression was especially intended to impress her diffidence, and they annotated the video with "Emotion Mirroring".

The last part looks like a slogan of this campaign, and so "Slogan" is assigned.
