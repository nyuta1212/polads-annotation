## Examples

Annotation IDs (such as "emotion-1") are shown on top of the video frames, where the same 
IDs appear in the chart below and the "Comments on each annotation" section (actual IDs 
when you annotate are random letters, but we changed them here for readability). 

The "Comments on each annotation" section shows the comments that you will provide when 
annotating." 

The "Note" section provides explanation about why this video has these annotations.

#### Comments on each annotation

- **claim-1**: claim what Trump brought
- **claim-2**: claim what Biden will do
- **claim-3**: claim what Trump will do
- **mood-1**: dark, greyscale


### Note

This video mostly highlights what Trump did and will do. The first part and the last part are edited to impress that he has done well and so he will (either it's true or not). Because of this, the annotator assigned "Implication of Claim" (claim-1 and claim-3). 

Meanwhile, around 25-35 seconds, the video says negative things with showing a picture of Biden, in order to impress that he may not do well (leading to claim-2). This comes with a dark mood in black-and-white scenes. Aside from the negative content, this part seems to have an additional intention to provide some negative emotion by the color.
