## Examples

Annotation IDs (such as "emotion-1") are shown on top of the video frames, where the same 
IDs appear in the chart below and the "Comments on each annotation" section (actual IDs 
when you annotate are random letters, but we changed them here for readability). 

The "Comments on each annotation" section shows the comments that you will provide when 
annotating." 

The "Note" section provides explanation about why this video has these annotations.

#### Comments on each annotation

- **mood-1**: dark, depressing
- **claim-1**: Trump failed
- **slogan-1**: he'll lead
- **mirroing-1**: negative emotion


### Note

This video is for Biden's campaign, claiming bad things about the administration at the time (claim-1). It also comes with a dark mood. The annotation says that this video also tries "Emotion Mirroring" (mirroring-1), but **THIS IS NOT VERY ACCURATE ANNOTATION**: It should have been "Implication of Emotion" because it invokes negative emotions by the content itself but not facial expression.
